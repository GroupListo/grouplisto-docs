# Contact Categories

Organize your contacts using circles and priorities.

## Circle Categories

The **Circle** field helps you categorize contacts based on your relationship with them:

| Circle | Color | Use For |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Family** | 🟢 Green | Relatives, close family members |
| **Friends** | 🔵 Blue | Personal friends, social connections |
| **Work** | 🟡 Yellow | Colleagues, professional contacts |
| **Sport** | 🔴 Red | Gym buddies, sports team members |
| **Neighbors** | ⚪ Gray | People from your neighborhood |
| **Other** | ⚪ Gray | Anyone who doesn't fit above categories |

### Why Use Circles?

Circles help you:
- **Filter your list** - View only friends, or only work contacts
- **Prioritize follow-ups** - Focus on specific groups
- **Track progress** - See how you're doing with each circle

## Priority System

Use **Priority** (1-10) to rank how important a contact is:

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **1-3** | High priority - Follow up first |
| **4-6** | Medium priority - Regular follow-ups |
| **7-10** | Lower priority - Eventually contact |

### Tips for Setting Priorities

- **High priority**: People who showed strong interest
- **Medium priority**: Warm contacts, need nurturing
- **Low priority**: Cold contacts, long-term prospects

## Presentation Status

The **Presentation** toggle indicates whether the contact has seen your presentation:

- ✅ **Yes** - They've seen the presentation
- ❌ **No** - Not yet presented to

This helps you track who still needs to be shown the opportunity.

## Filtering by Category

2. Select the criteria:
