## Activating Contacts

When one of your contacts registers and becomes a team member:

2. They appear in your **My Team** list
3. You can now see their progress

### How Contact Activation Works

2. You share your referral link with them
3. They register using your link
4. GroupListo automatically:
   - Links their account to your team
   - Marks your contact as "activated"
   - Preserves the contact history
