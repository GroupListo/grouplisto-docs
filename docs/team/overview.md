# Team Overview

## What is "My Team"?

**My Team** shows all the people who registered using your referral code. These are your direct team members in the network structure.

## Accessing Your Team

## Team List Information

For each team member, you can see:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Photo** | Their profile picture |
| **Name** | First and last name |
| **Phone** | Contact phone number |
| **Email** | Email address |
| **Circle** | How you categorized them (before they registered) |
| **List** | Total contacts in their entire structure |
| **Team** | Their direct team members count |
| **Registration** | When they joined |

## Understanding the Metrics

### List Count

The **List** number shows the total count of everyone in that person's downline:
- Their contacts
- Their team members' contacts
- And so on, recursively

### Team Count

The **Team** number shows their direct team members - people who registered with their referral code.

## Viewing Team Member Details

Click on any team member to see:
- Their contact information
- Their contact list (with your permission level)
- Their sub-team

## Team Hierarchy

GroupListo supports multi-level team structures:

```
You
├── Team Member A
│   ├── A's Team Member 1
│   └── A's Team Member 2
└── Team Member B
    └── B's Team Member 1
```

You can drill down into your team members' teams to see the full structure.
